<p>The interplay between laser light, trapped particles, and fluid flow can produce counterintuitive effects in optical tweezing. Here we uncover an attractive, long-ranged, non-equilibrium force field centered on an optically trapped particle near a water-oil interface, produced by local heating and mediated by global fluid flow. This causes surrounding untrapped colloids, tethered to the interface but allowed to diffusely freely along it, to crystallize around the force center. In this configuration, the non-equilibrium force is the gradient of a potential, of strength proportional to the local heating, which, surprisingly, allows for an effective equilibrium description. Our results open unexplored routes to optofluidic manipulation and assembly of colloidal particles.</p>

<p>Our work shows that the oscillatory dynamics of a pair of active particles near
a boundary, best exemplified by the fascinating dance of the green algae
Volvox, can be understood in terms of Hamiltonian mechanics, even though the
system does not conserve energy. At the heart of this dance, which is a limit
cycle of a dynamical system, is a Hamiltonian, damped  by gravitational torque
and driven by fluid flow reflected off the boundary. 
For small oscillations, this Hamiltonian is identical to that of a pendulum and, like a metronome, sets
the beat of the dance. For large oscillations, the beat can be evaluated with
the same mathematics as for a pendulum, and when damping and driving are taken
into account, agrees very well with experiment. This establishes without doubt
that the enigmatic Volvox dance, rather than being an evolutionarily selected
biological phenomenon, is a physical phenomenon that can be understood fully
in terms of the familiar concepts of mechanics. Our study highlights the
significance of fluid flows and their distortion by boundaries in active matter
and shows that the applicability of Hamiltonian mechanics extends beyond its
intended domain of energy-conserving systems to time-irreversible, dissipative,
active systems.</p>

<p>
Microase separation (phase separation arrested to a length-scale) is often observed in suspensions of spherical active particles. In such suspensions, the scalar concentration is the only order parameter, when there is no orientational order in the bulk. We show that such microphase separations can be achieved by extending theories of passive binary mixtures (for example, phase separation of oil droplets in passive binary oil-water mixtures). In thermal equilibrium systems, phase separation is a thermodynamic process where a uniformly mixed state can lower its free energy by dividing into phases. Ostwald ripening (small droplets disappear and bigger droplets grow) drives thermal equilibrium systems to full phase separation. We show that, by coupling the scalar density to fluid flow, the negative mechanical tension of an active suspension creates, via a self-shearing instability, a steady-state life cycle of droplet growth interrupted by division whose scaling behavior we predict.

<p>Active colloids - microorganisms, synthetic microswimmers, and self-propelling droplets - are known to self-organize into ordered structures at fluid-solid boundaries. Their mutual entrainment in the attractive component of the flow has been postulated as a possible mechanism underlying this phenomenon. In this work, we describe this fluid-induced phase separation by combining experiments, theory, and numerical simulations, and demonstrate its control by changing the hydrodynamic boundary conditions. We show that, for flow in Hele-Shaw cells, metastable lines or stable traveling bands of colloids can be obtained by varying the cell height, while for flow bounded by a plane, dynamic crystallites are formed. At a plane no-slip wall, these crystallites are characterized by a continuous out-of-plane flux of particles that circulate and re-enter at the crystallite edges, thereby stabilizing them, while the crystallites are strictly two-dimensional at a plane where the tangential stress vanishes. These results are elucidated by deriving, using the boundary-domain integral formulation of Stokes flow, exact expressions for dissipative, long-ranged, many-body active forces and torques between them in respective boundary conditions. The resulting numerical simulations of motion under the action of the active forces and torques are in excellent agreement with experiments. Our work demonstrates the control of phase separation of active particles by boundary conditions.</p>

<p>Recent experiments have reported the arrest of phase separation in a suspension of active colloids at a plane wall. Attractive hydrodynamic forces are known to cause the aggregation of active colloids at a plane wall. This flow-induced phase separation, in absence of any other interactions, drives the system to a complete phase separation. Here, we describe the role of chemical interactions in modifying this flow-induced phase separation of active colloids at a plane wall. We derive chemohydrodynamic forces and torques on colloids in the limit of rapid diffusion and slow viscous flow. We find that near a plane wall, these forces can be expressed as a gradient of a non-equilibrium potential. This potential can be varied from being purely repulsive to purely attractive by tuning the chemical activity of the colloids. The arrest of phase separation can then be understood from the emergence of a barrier in the effective potential.</p>

<p>In the work, we consider a suspension of driven particles. Unlike an active colloid, a driven colloid can move only under the effect of external potentials. Here, we study the motion of particles under electrohydrodynamic flow in a rectangular geometry. Electrohydrodynamics is the study of the effects of electrostatic forces on fluid flow. Electrohydrodynamic flows result from the motion of free charges on the surface of a fluid by application of a tangential electric field along with the container (Melcher and Taylor, Annu Rev Fluid Mech 1969). In our case, free charged ions are sprayed using electrospray on the air-liquid interface of a rectangular container with an electrode, which provides a tangential electric field. The spray from the cone deposits charges at the air-liquid interface which is then set into motion by the tangential electric field due to the electrode. Thus, the formation of nanoparticle-nanosheet (NP-NS) is observed at the air-liquid interface.</p>

<p>It is well-known that crystallization of colloids approximating hard spheres
is due, paradoxically, to the higher entropy of the ordered crystalline state
compared to that of  the disordered liquid state. Out of equilibrium, no such general
principle is available to rationalize crystallization. Here, we identify a new non-equilibrium mechanism, associated with entropy production rather than entropy gain, which drives crystallization of active colloids near plane walls. This is a new mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking, with no analogue in equilibrium. The properties of the non-equilibrium crystal, consequently, show remarkable exceptions: strong dissipation suppresses propagating phonon-modes and turns them diffusive, yet, activity enhances the elastic moduli of the crystal. An active crystal, then, has reduced phase fluctuations and is less susceptible to the destruction of long-ranged order, even though it is two-dimensional. The investigation of topological phase transitions in these systems presents, therefore, exciting avenues for future research. There is an excellent qualitative and quantitative match of our results with two recent experiments.</p>

<p>The simplest system in which an interplay of non-uniform external fields, activity and Brownian motion can be studied is an active colloid confined in a three-dimensional harmonic potential. We consider two examples: (a) active particles in a single trap, and (b) active particles in a lattice of harmonic traps (optical lattice).</p>
