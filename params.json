I am graduate student in physics at The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I am working in soft condensed matter physics. More precisely, I study the hydrodynamic interactions of active dynamical systems at low Reynolds number.\r\n\r\nMy PhD advisor is [Dr. Ronojoy Adhikari](rjoy.in/contact)\r\n\r\nSome of us, students at my institute, meet on Fridays for [discussions](http://www.imsc.res.in/~rsingh/discussion/cond-mat/cond-mat.html) on condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics. In an another event, we meet on Wednesdays to discuss [python programming](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyTutorials) and its use to tackle physics problems.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nResearch Fellow in Physics \r\nOffice - 116 \r\nThe Institute of Mathematical Sciences \r\nIV Cross Road, \r\nCIT CampusTaramani \r\nChennai 600 113 \r\nTamil Nadu, India. \r\n\r\n#### Email:\r\nrajeshrinet at gmail dot com \r\n\r\nrsingh at imsc dot res dot in","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
