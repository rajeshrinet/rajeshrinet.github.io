Active particles are a new class of colloids which create flow - even when stationary - due to large surface gradients from local nonequilibrium processes. These nonequilibrium processes may be due to the motion of cilia, as in microorganisms (Brennen & Winet, 1977) or osmotic flows of various kinds in response to spontaneously generated gradients of phoretic fields (Ebbens & Howse, 2010) at the colloidal particle. The latter, often called autophoresis, is a generalisation of well-known phoretic phenomena including, <em>inter alia</em>, electrophoresis (electric field), diffusiophoresis (chemical field) and thermophoresis (temperature field) that occur in response to externally imposed gradients of phoretic fields (Anderson, 1989).
<br>

<p>
Hydrodynamic and phoretic interactions between active particles in a viscous fluid are central to the understanding of their collective dynamics. Under experimentally relevant conditions, the motion of the fluid flow is governed by the Stokes equation and that of the phoretic field, if one is present, by the Laplace equation. The “activity” appears in these equations as boundary conditions on the particle surfaces that prescribe the slip velocity in the Stokes equation and flux of the phoretic field in the Laplace equation. We solve these equations simultaneously - using a grid-free method, combining the integral representation of Laplace and Stokes equations, spectral expansion, and Galerkin discretization - to compute phoretic and hydrodynamic interactions between spheres with slip boundary conditions on their surfaces. This formalism has been implemented in a numerical library, <a href="https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pystokes">PyStokes</a>, to study phoresis and Stokesian hydrodynamics in Python. The resulting methodology has been applied to study various experimental phenomena of recent interest in active matter.

<hr>
Field-theoretic description of active matter systems can be obtained from coarse-graining the microscopic dynamics. An alternative way is to write the continuum equations for the dynamics of the order parameter that respect the underlying symmetries of the system and break the detailed balance condition minimally. I have explored such field theories without time-reversal symmetries to understand recent experiments in active matter, as summarized below.

<h4 id="2020">Splitting active droplets</h4>
<hr>

<br>
Microphase separation (phase separation arrested to a length-scale) is often observed in suspensions of spherical active particles. In such suspensions, the scalar concentration is the only order parameter, when there is no orientational order in the bulk. We show that such microphase separations can be achieved by extending theories of passive binary mixtures (for example, phase separation of oil droplets in passive binary oil-water mixtures). In thermal equilibrium systems, phase separation is a thermodynamic process where a uniformly mixed state can lower its free energy by dividing into phases. Ostwald ripening (small droplets disappear and bigger droplets grow) drives thermal equilibrium systems to full phase separation. We show that, by coupling the scalar density to fluid flow, the negative mechanical tension of an active suspension creates, via a self-shearing instability, a steady-state life cycle of droplet growth interrupted by division whose scaling behavior we predict.

 Our starting point is a scalar field theory with mass and momentum conservation (model H). A self-shearing instability is obtained if active extensile stress, which does not respect time-reversal symmetry, is added to the momentum conservation equation in model H. This instability interrupts the growth of droplets by splitting them. The extensile active stress has the effect of reversing the sign of the effective tension which arrests the growth. This is balanced by Ostwald ripening: small droplets evaporate while large ones grow until they in turn become unstable. The result is a dynamical steady state maintained by the self-shearing instability.

In this work, we present a model of self-propulsion in active droplets, such as cells, by extending the above theory to two scalar fields. The two scalar fields, in the case of a cell, represent the cytoplasm and a contractile cortex. An active stress couples the two scalar fields. The self-propulsion results from the activity when rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken. We find, both analytically and numerically, that the swimming speed does not depend on the radius of the droplet, while it varies linearly with the activity parameter and with the droplet area fraction.

<hr>

<p>I am also interested in exploring how techniques of statistical mechanics can be used to design fast inference tools. In probability theory and statistics, <a href="http://www.gaussianprocess.org/">Gaussian processes</a> has been an area of extensive research in the past few decades. We have developed an O(N) method for inference of a stationary Gauss-Markov processes using four sufficient statistics matrices. This is in contrast to O(N^{3}) cost using the general Gaussian process, which makes approximate methods a necessity for large data-sets. Our method, on the other hand, exploits the Gauss-Markov property to obtain accurate and efficient inference. The formalism is then used to do inference on experimental data and we find that it outperforms fitting and sampling methods both in accuracy and speed.</p>

A recent interest is the application of mathematical and statistical tools to study the spread of infectious diseases. 
In particular, 
we seek to obtain the optimal intervention strategies which minimize the transmission of infection. For this, we have developed a numerical library, <a href="https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross">PyRoss</a>, which provides an integrated platform for inference, forecasts, and control for epidemiological models.
