<hr>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshrinet/pystokes-misc/master/gallery/figs/thisPyIm.png"></p>

Active particles are a new class of colloids which create flow - even when stationary - due to large surface gradients from local nonequilibrium processes. These nonequilibrium processes may be due to the motion of cilia, as in microorganisms (Brennen & Winet, 1977) or osmotic flows of various kinds in response to spontaneously generated gradients of phoretic fields (Ebbens & Howse, 2010) at the colloidal particle. The latter, often called autophoresis, is a generalisation of well-known phoretic phenomena including, <em>inter alia</em>, electrophoresis (electric field), diffusiophoresis (chemical field) and thermophoresis (temperature field) that occur in response to externally imposed gradients of phoretic fields (Anderson, 1989).
<br>
<br>
<p>Hydrodynamic and phoretic interactions between active particles in a viscous fluid are central to the understanding of their collective dynamics.  Under experimentally relevant conditions, the motion of the fluid is governed by the Stokes equation and that of the phoretic field, if one is present, by the Laplace equation.  The “activity” appears in these equations as boundary conditions on the particle surfaces that prescribe the slip velocity in the Stokes equation and flux of the phoretic field in the Laplace equation</p>


<p>The slip velocity and the phoretic flux are related by a linear constitutive law that can be derived from a detailed analysis of the boundary layer physics (Anderson, 1989). The Stokes and Laplace equations are coupled by this linear constitutive law only at the particle boundaries. The linearity of the governing equations and the coupling boundary conditions allows for a formally exact solution of the problem of determining the force per unit area on the particle surfaces. This formally exact solution can be approximated to any desired degree of accuracy by a truncated series expansion in a complete basis of functions on the particle boundaries. This, in turn, leads to an efficient and accurate numerical method for computing hydrodynamic and phoretic interactions between active particles.</p>

<p>I have also developed a numerical library <a href="https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pystokes">PyStokes</a> to study phoresis and Stokesian hydrodynamics in Python. It uses a grid-free method, combining the integral representation of Laplace and Stokes equations, spectral expansion, and Galerkin discretization, to compute phoretic and hydrodynamic interactions between spheres with slip boundary conditions on their surfaces. The library also computes suspension scale quantities, such as rheological response, energy dissipation and fluid flow. The computational cost is quadratic in the number of particles and upto 1e5 particles have been accommodated on multicore computers. The library has been used to model suspensions of microorganisms, synthetic autophoretic particles and self-propelling droplets.</p>

<h3><a name="About" class="anchor" href="#About"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Continuum theories of active matter</h3>
<hr>

I have pursed two directions in continuum theoretic of active matter. The first work presents a two dimensional model of self-propulsion in active droplets, such as cells, involving two scalar fields, representing the cytoplasm and a contractile cortex. An active stress couples the two scalar fields. The self-propulsion results from the activity when rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken.

The second is motivated by experimental observation of microphase separation in disparate experiments of spherical active colloids. At the continuum level, there is no orientational order due to absence of alignment interactions, and thus, the only order parameter for such particles is their scalar concentration. Currently, a field theoretic understanding of this microphase separation via the arrest of droplet growth (as opposed to bicontinuous structures) ignores hydrodynamic interactions, but these are an important part of all the experiments reporting microphase separation. In this work, I have shown that microphase separation is possible with activity in the hydrodynamic sector (fluid flow) alone. Contractile mechanical stresses lead to a novel self-shearing instability, which interrupts the growth of droplets (or bubbles) by splitting. This is balanced by Ostwald ripening: small droplets evaporate while large ones grow until they in turn become unstable. The result is a dynamical steady state maintained by the self-shearing instability

I have also developed a numerical library <a href="https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pygl">PyGL</a> to study such field theories without time-reversal symmetry. The library can be used to study models of statistical physics of various symmetries and conservation laws. In particular, we allow models with mass and momentum conservations. The library constructs differentiation matrices using finite-difference and spectral methods. To study the role of momentum conservation, the library also allows computing fluid flow from the solution of the Stokes equation.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am also interested in exploring how techniques of statistical mechanics can be used to design fast inference tools. In probability theory and statistics, <a href="http://www.gaussianprocess.org/">Gaussian processes</a> has been an area of extensive research in the past few decades. I have developed an O(N) method for inference of a stationary Gauss-Markov processes using four sufficient statistics matrices. This is in contrast to O(N^{3}) cost using the general Gaussian process, which makes approximate methods a necessity for large data-sets. My method, on the other hand, exploits the Gauss-Markov property to obtain accurate and efficient inference. The formalism is then used to do inference on experimental data and we find that it outperforms fitting and sampling methods both in accuracy and speed.</p>

I am also interested in application of mathematical and statistical tools to study the spread of infectious diseases. In particular, 
we seek to obtain the optimal intervention strategies which minimize the transmission of infection. For this, we use our numerical 
library <a href="https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross">PyRoss</a> which provides an integrated platform for inference, forecasts, and control for epidemiological models.
