##Welcome to my homepage!
Hi! I am graduate student in physics at The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai.

Currently, I am working in soft condensed matter physics. More precisely, I study the hydrodynamic interactions of active dynamical systems at low Reynolds number.

My PhD advisor is [Dr. Ronojoy Adhikari](rjoy.in/contact)

Some of us, students at my institute, meet on Fridays for [discussions](http://www.imsc.res.in/~rsingh/discussion/cond-mat/cond-mat.html) on condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics. In an another event, we meet on Wednesdays to discuss [python programming](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyTutorials) and its use to tackle physics problems.
